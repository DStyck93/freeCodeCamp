<h1>Learn Form Validation by Building a Calorie Counter</h1>

<p>Sometimes when you're coding a web application, you'll need to be able to accept input from a<br>

based on that input, and dynamically update your interface to display the results.</p>

<p>In this practice project, you'll learn basic regular expressions, template literals, the<br>
